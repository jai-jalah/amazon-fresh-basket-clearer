# Amazon Fresh Basket Clearer

**Currently in progress - 85% complete.** 

For some reason, Amazon Fresh doesn't have a delete all/clear basket option. This is pretty annoying if you're trying to meal plan for and calculate expenses for different plans. I figured I could make one to make that easier and also have some fun!

## How To Use

1. `Git clone git@github.com:jai-jk/amazon-fresh-basket-clearer.git`.
2. Change into project directory i.e. `cd amazon-fresh-basket-clearer`.
3. Install any dependencies listed at the the top of project files with pip3 i.e. `pip3 install selenium`.
4. Replace environment variables with custom data.
5. Run `python3 main.py`

This project is designed to be easily modifiable if the Amazon UI changes, so you can replace any selectors that no longer work yourself if you wish to. Refer to the Selenium WebDrive docs if you want to learn more :) https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html
